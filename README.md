# ubi-call

## Opiniated excercice

- choose not to use Moment.js, I should have!
- choose not to use TS, I should have!
- choose not to use any i18n tooling

## this that would have be nice todo:

- implement a startofweek props on Monday/Sunday
- have made it in TS with custom date type to avoid a UTC mess (maybe handled here)
- add a "today" class
- pass slot to child for previous and next month, ex: https://gist.github.com/loilo/73c55ed04917ecf5d682ec70a2a1b8e2
- more on CSS and customization with saas
- more on packaging, ...
